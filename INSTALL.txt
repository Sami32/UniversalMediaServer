Installers for Windows and Mac OS X and tarballs for Linux can be found at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/

To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the
following commands (replace <version> with the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but something similar
should work on most Unix distributions)

1) Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):

    # If a Java Virtual Machine is not installed yet, you will need to install one :
    sudo apt-get install mediainfo openjdk-7-jre
    # or
    # sudo apt-get install mediainfo openjdk-8-jre
    #
    # you can also optionally install dcraw and VLC: sudo apt-get install dcraw vlc
    #
    # Some linux distributions, as Ubuntu 64-bit, will need to load some more libraries to be able to support DTS with tsMuxeR:
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 libbz2-1.0:i386 libstdc++6:i386

    # and http://askubuntu.com/questions/637113/unable-to-locate-package-lib32bz2-1-0
    #
    # On some Linux distibution you will also need to install libzen when installing libmediainfo, if you don't know just
    # install it to avoid issues.
    sudo apt-get install libmediainfo libzen

2) Download the tarball e.g.:

    # if wget isn't installed, run: sudo apt-get install wget
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/Windows/UMS-<version>.tgz/download

3) Extract the tarball into a ums-<version> directory:

    tar xzvf ums-<version>.tgz

4) Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):

    cd ums-<version>
    ./UMS.sh

UMS accesses some files in the ums-<version> directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in ~/.config/UMS
